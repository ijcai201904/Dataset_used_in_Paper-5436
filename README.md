# Dataset-for-Allocating-Fog-Computing-Resources-Paper
This is the dataset used in the simulation in the allocating fog computing resources paper.

## Dataset Description
There are two datasets, one is for simulations under different resource coefficients, the other is for simulations under different task deadline slackness. For every parameter, we generate 200 groups of data. The names of the files are self explanatory, and the details of how the data is generated is in our paper.
